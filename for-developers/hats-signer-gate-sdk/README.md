# ğŸ‘’ Hats Signer Gate SDK

## Overview

Hats Signer Gate (HSG) is a contract that grants multisig signing rights to addresses wearing a given Hat, enabling on-chain organizations (such as DAOs) to revocably delegate constrained signing authority and responsibility to individuals.

Multi Hats Signer Gate (MHSG) is a modification of HSG that supports setting multiple Hats as valid signer Hats.

The SDK is an open source JavaScript client for creating and interacting with HSG and/or MHSG instances and was designed to work both in the browser and in Node.js.
