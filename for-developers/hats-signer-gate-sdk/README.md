# ðŸ‘’ Hats Signer Gate SDK

{% hint style="warning" %}
This SDK currently uses Hats Signer Gate v1. There is a new version, [Hats Signer Gate v2](../hats-signer-gate-v2.md), which should be used instead. The docs for this SDK will be updated and this note will be removed once this SDK has been updated to work with v2.
{% endhint %}

## Overview

Hats Signer Gate (HSG) is a contract that grants multisig signing rights to addresses wearing a given Hat, enabling on-chain organizations (such as DAOs) to revocably delegate constrained signing authority and responsibility to individuals.

Multi Hats Signer Gate (MHSG) is a modification of HSG that supports setting multiple Hats as valid signer Hats.

The SDK is an open source JavaScript client for creating and interacting with HSG and/or MHSG instances and was designed to work both in the browser and in Node.js.
