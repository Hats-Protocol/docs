# Subscription or Membership Fee (Unlock Protocol)

### **Overview** <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

Hats has integrated with Unlock Protocol to allow organizations to set up recurring subscriptions or one-time membership fees for roles. When you add a subscription or membership fee to a role, a unique claim page is automatically generated for fee collection and onboarding.

Once a subscription or membership is active, the new member immediately gains all associated role powers, such as access to workspaces, communication channels, and voting rights. If the subscription is canceled or expires, access is automatically revoked.
