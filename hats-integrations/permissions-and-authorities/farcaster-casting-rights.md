# Farcaster Casting Rights

Hats Farcaster Delegator enables non-custodial shared Farcaster accounts. Organizations and groups can use it to share a Farcaster account and delegate casting rights to individuals by minting them a hat. The best place to use Hats Farcaster Delegator today is in [Herocast](https://herocast.xyz), the open-source Farcaster client for power users and teams, with whom weâ€™ve worked closely.

**Example:** The Charmverse Farcaster account is now controlled by 3 different addresses wearing the [Charmverse Caster hat](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/10/86?hatId=86.1.1.1). This hat can be minted to new addresses, immediately giving them the ability to post to the Charmverse Farcaster account. Later, if the Charmverse Farcaster Caster hat were to be revoked from one of the casters, that individual would immediately lose their ability to cast on behalf of Charmverse.

**How you can use it:** [Get in touch](https://hatsprotocol.deform.cc/getintouch/) to schedule a 30-minute onboarding call.
