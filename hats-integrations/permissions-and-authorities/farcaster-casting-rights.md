**Example:** The Charmverse Farcaster account is now controlled by 3 different addresses wearing the [Charmverse Caster hat](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/10/86?hatId=86.1.1.1). This hat can be minted to new addresses, immediately giving them the ability to post to the Charmverse Farcaster account. Later, if the Charmverse Farcaster Caster hat were to be revoked from one of the casters, that individual would immediately lose their ability to cast on behalf of Charmverse.
