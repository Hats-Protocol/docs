## Two Options for Hat-Gating Discord

The two token-gating platforms most commonly used for connecting Discord authorities to specific hats are 1) Collab.Land and 2) Guild.xyz. In either case, the basic steps are the same:

* Connect your Discord server to Collab.Land or Guild.xyz
* Add a requirement that an address must hold a specific Hats token ID in order to receive a given Discord role
* Give that Discord role access to specific permissions and channels within Discord

Following are detailed descriptions of how to use each gating option:

* [**Guild.xyz**](guild.xyz-greater-than-discord.md)
