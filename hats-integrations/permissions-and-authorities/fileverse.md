# Fileverse

Hats are coming to the Fileverse collaboration suite and smart contracts. Their integration of Hats is designed to make it easy for any person, team or community, whether they are onchain and online, to collaborate without relying on intermediaries like Google Suite or Notion. The integration means that Fileverse users will have full access to the automation power of Hats Modules to manage their communityâ€™s access to their files and documents.

**Example:** Filverse created a simple [Hats tree](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/100/100?hatId=100.1) to give stakers of the $SPORK token (the governance token of the EthDenver DAO) special voting power in a [game of onchain love](https://ethdenver.fileverse.io/) for EthDenver speakers.
