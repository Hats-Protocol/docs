## Two Options for Hat-Gating Telegram

The two token-gating platforms most commonly used for connecting Telegram channels to specific hats are 1) Collab.Land and 2) Guild.xyz. We recommend using Collab.Land, as unlike Guild, Collab.Land allows a single hat to gain access to multiple distinct Telegram channels.

Following are detailed descriptions of how to use each gating option:

* [**Collab.Land**](collab.land-greater-than-telegram.md)
* [**Guild.xyz**](guild.xyz-greater-than-telegram.md)
