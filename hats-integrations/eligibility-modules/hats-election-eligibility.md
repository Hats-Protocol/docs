# Hats Election Eligibility

## **Overview**

A Hats Protocol Eligibility Module which sets eligibility for a hat based on the results of an election for a given term (conducted elsewhere). Terms are defined as the timestamp after the term ends. This contract allows for the next term to be set while the current term has not yet ended, which allows for an election for the next term to be conducted while the current term is still active.

The module's code is open source and is available [here](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-elections-eligibility).
