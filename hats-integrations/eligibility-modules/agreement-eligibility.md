# Agreement Eligibility

## Overview

The Agreement Eligibility is a Hats Protocol module that a community or organization can use to enable individuals to join the community by signing an agreement.

When an individual signs the agreement, they also receive a hat that grants them access to the community. If a new agreement is published, community members must sign the new agreement in order to keep wearing the hat.

## **Adding the module to a hat**

* Go to the tree that includes the hat you wish to create the module for
* Select "Edit Tree"
* Locate and select the hat
* Open the "Revocation & Eligibility" section
* Choose "Agreement Eligibility" in the module type
