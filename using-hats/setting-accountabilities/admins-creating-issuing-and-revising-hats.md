# ðŸ§™ Admins: Creating, Issuing, and Revising Hats

## Overview

In Hats Protocol, admins are specific hats that can change a child hat's details, image, max supply, eligibility address, and toggle address â€” as long as that child hat is mutable (immutable hats cannot be changed once deployed). Admin hats can also mint both mutable and immutable hats to new wearers, and transfer mutable hats from one address to another.

Each hat is an admin of all other hats linked directly below it, as seen in the diagram below:&#x20;
