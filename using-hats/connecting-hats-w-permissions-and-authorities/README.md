# üîê Connecting Hats w/ Permissions & Authorities

Hats makes it easy for organizations to manage permissions and access for their human and AI agents across the open internet. The number of permissions and authorities that can be granted and accessed by a hat is constantly growing, including:

* **Accounts and resources:** control of Ethereum accounts, multisig signing authority, and compensation
* **Communication channels:** access and posting rights for shared communications channels and accounts
* **Governance and voting:** onchain permissions for any smart contract, proposal creation, and voting power
* **Workspaces:** read, review & write permissions in workspaces, files & docs

These powers can be granted and revoked by designated individual or group admins, as well as based on a wide range of automated [eligibility and accountability criteria](../../hats-integrations/eligibility-and-accountability-criteria/).
